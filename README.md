# A Race Syllabus
A syllabus for self-education about race.

Basically I have two phases:

1. Make it easy to populate this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCx5VWQr7FU8o_y_tjxBayaQs_Ldg6zQJRONMRW0BR0/edit#gid=0

That is, so I could type in an ISBN, for example, into a web form and it would create an appropriate row in the spreadsheet.

2. Make a website based on all these resources, so people could kind of guide themselves through learning in various ways.
