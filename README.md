# A Race Syllabus
A syllabus for self-education about race.

Basically I have two phases:

1. Make it easy to populate this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCx5VWQr7FU8o_y_tjxBayaQs_Ldg6zQJRONMRW0BR0/edit#gid=0

That is, so I could type in an ISBN, for example, into a web form and it would create an appropriate row in the spreadsheet. Most realistically, Google Sheets would just make a query to a database and make the rows from the database.

2. Make a website based on all these resources, so people could kind of guide themselves through learning in various ways.

So ideally, start by making one single database that Google Sheets could use, but that could later still be used/expanded by the website version.
